        <div class="heading-medium-3">Behind the scene</div>
        <div class="paragraph-1-0">I started at Ziroh Labs as an intern, and my first task was an exciting project called ZUNU Analytics. The concept was thrilling: a decentralized network linking countless computers globally, all anonymous, creating the first-ever secure supercomputer. However, the project was unexpectedly put on hold. I felt a mix of disappointment and concern, unsure of what lay ahead. But then, something uplifting happened.</div>
        <div class="paragraph-1-0">Just two days later, the CEO called me! He appreciated the hard work I&#x27;d poured into the project and offered me a full-time position. Even better, he presented me with a new challenge: a problem statement for Zunu Drive. I was beyond excited and eager to dive deep into understanding what this innovative idea could blossom into in the future.</div>
        <div class="text-4">Embarking on a Design Odyssey!</div>
        <div class="paragraph-1-0">When the challenge to designing Zunu Drive came to me, I began with sketching a dashboard for a desktop app, thinking about all the features and user flows that currently available platforms provides to their users. I mixed ideas from these platforms and came up with a new, combined dashboard design for Zunu Drive. It was a fun and exciting start, blending different elements to create something new and user-friendly!</div>
        <div class="paragraph-1-0">In the world of digital design, creating Zunu Drive was a journey where practical use and user experience (UX) came together. As a product designer, turning the idea into a reality was a unique challenge and opportunity.</div>

What&#x27;s more, it uniquely allows users to integrate and manage their preferred cloud services within the Zunu interface, providing a familiar yet secure environment. While these other services are valuable, Zunu Drive offers a comprehensive solution that could very well lead users to choose it over the aforementioned options.
